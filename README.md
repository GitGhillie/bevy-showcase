# bevy-showcase
What it looks like: https://youtu.be/wAUfcMfv4ho

## Controls
- WASD + Space to move around
- Hold left mouse button on an object to drag it
- Press right mouse button to spawn a new prop

## How to build
- Unfortunately I can't share the assets but if there is enough interest I can write instructions on how to create those.
- For bevy_fmod some external libs are needed, see https://github.com/Salzian/bevy_fmod
